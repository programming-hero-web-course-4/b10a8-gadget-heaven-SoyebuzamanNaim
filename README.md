## üöÄ React Fundamentals Used

   - Each part of the UI is a separate React component, enabling better reusability and maintainability.
  
### 2. **JSX (JavaScript XML)**  
   - Used for rendering UI components efficiently by combining HTML-like syntax within JavaScript.

### 3. **State Management with `useState` and Context API**  
   - Used to manage both local and global states across components.

### 4. **Lifecycle Methods with `useEffect`**  
   - For handling side effects like data fetching and DOM manipulations.

### 5. **React Router for Navigation**  
   - Implemented navigation with dynamic routes using `react-router-dom`.

### 6. **Event Handling**  
   - Used for various user interactions like button clicks and form submissions.

### 7. **Conditional Rendering**  
   - Dynamically rendering UI based on certain conditions like active links, user actions, and state values.

### 8. **Props Drilling and Destructuring**  
   - Passing data between components via props for flexible and controlled data flow.

### 9. **Dynamic Class Binding**  
   - Managing dynamic CSS classes based on the state of the component or route.

### 10. **Error Handling**  
   - Error boundaries and fallback UI using React components.
